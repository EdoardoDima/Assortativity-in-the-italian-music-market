# Inner working of the italian music scene

### I really wanted to analyze the dynamics between genres and the assortativity of the italian music scene... so I kinda did that by getting data from the Spotify API, then building a network of collaborations between artist that can be easily decomposed to only represent single genres
### There's a nice .pdf file which is gonna tell you about the whole process
#### (no for real read the .pdf I put way too much effort into making it look cute)
